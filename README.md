# TN93.js

This is a simple Javascript program to quantify the difference between two
DNA sequences. The algorithm is commonly called TN93, after its authors (Tamura
and Nei) and the year in which they published it (1993). The Original Source is
[here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8336541).

This borrows significantly from the C implementation of the same algorithm,
[libtn93](https://github.com/sdwfrost/libtn93), though it's been manually
recoded in Javascript, rather than [transpiled](http://webassembly.org/).
